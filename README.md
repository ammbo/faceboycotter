# Notes

1. I'd love to use the FB ads library API, but that requires a FB app, which requires me to have an account and it requires the user to OAuth into the app, which requires them to have an account. Yuck.
2. I'd love to link to the search page or somehow pre-fill the ads library. But that does not seem to work.
3. The code is kludge. Feel free to improve it, it is very much a beta.
